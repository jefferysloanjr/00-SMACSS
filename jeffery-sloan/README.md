##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I had referenced the SMACCS, read through what belongs in which css file and placed them in the appropriate file.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not refactor any of the existing CSS simply because it was function properly and did not see a necessity to change it.
